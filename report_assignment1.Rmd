```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
mydata = read.csv("activity.csv") # read csv file
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r}
aggregate.data.frame(mydata$steps,list(mydata$date), sum)

```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

```{r}
mean(mydatatotal$x)
```

## Imputing missing values
```{r}
mean(mydatatotal$x, na.rm = TRUE)
```
## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?:


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
